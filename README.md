## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for its simplicity and broad range of libraries.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Combines user input and location data to query OpenAI's GPT model for doable, location-specific recycling insights.
- **API Integration** Uses OpenAI API to communicate with the machine learning model.
- **Geolocation Services** Uses the IPify API to fetch the user’s IP address and IPinfo API for mapping the IP address to a location.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides product details (e.g., name, type, material).
2. **Processing**: AI analyzes the input and retrieves location-specific recycling guidelines.
3. **Output**: A step-by-step guide on how to recycle the product properly.
